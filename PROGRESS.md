# AI-Powered CRM MVP - Development Progress

## 🎯 Project Overview
Building a one-night MVP that demonstrates two Vertex AI agents working together in a modern web app with:
- CRM Stage Builder Agent (pipeline creation)
- Omni Stage Agent (lead interaction)
- FastAPI backend + React frontend
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Kanban board + Lead table
- In-memory state with JSON persistence

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Setup (COMPLETED)

  - `google-adk==1.3.0`
  - `pydantic==2.11.4`
  - `cloudpickle==3.1.1`
  - `google-api-python-client==2.172.0`
  - `google-genai==1.20.0`
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `fastapi[standard]`
  - `uvicorn`
  - `websockets`

### Agent Connection Testing
- ✅ Environment variables configured correctly
- ✅ Vertex AI agent connection working

- ✅ Agent response received (intake process triggered)
- ✅ Session management working

### Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Agent authentication successful
- ✅ Ready to proceed with Phase 1

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Owner Chat UI (COMPLETED)

### Backend Architecture
- ✅ **FastAPI Application** (`backend/main.py`)
  - Health check endpoint: `GET /`
  - Owner chat endpoint: `POST /owner/chat`
  - File upload endpoint: `POST /owner/upload`
  - State management endpoints: `GET /state/{pipeline|leads|business}`
  - WebSocket endpoint: `WS /ws/{client_id}`
  - CORS middleware configured
  - Auto-save state management

- ✅ **Data Models** (`backend/models.py`)
  - Pydantic models for all API structures
  - ChatMessage, ChatResponse, PipelinePayload
  - LeadData, BusinessData, KanbanBoard
  - WebSocket and file upload models
  - Complete type safety

- ✅ **Agent Managers** (`backend/agents.py`)
  - CRMAgentManager: Handles CRM Stage Builder Agent
  - OmniAgentManager: Handles Omni Stage Agent
  - Session management with lazy loading
  - File upload integration
  - Pipeline completion detection
  - State extraction and transformation

- ✅ **State Manager** (`backend/state_manager.py`)
  - In-memory state with JSON persistence
  - Business data management
  - Lead tracking and stage progression
  - Kanban board auto-generation
  - Conversation history storage
  - Auto-save every 30 seconds

- ✅ **WebSocket Manager** (`backend/websocket_manager.py`)
  - Real-time connection management
  - Broadcast pipeline updates
  - Lead stage change notifications
  - Error handling and cleanup

### API Endpoints Tested
- ✅ `GET /` - Health check working
- ✅ `POST /owner/chat` - Owner chat working (connects to agent)
- ✅ `GET /state/pipeline` - Returns null (no pipeline yet)
- ✅ `GET /state/leads` - Returns empty array (no leads yet)
- ✅ `GET /docs` - Swagger documentation available

### File Upload Support
- ✅ PDF, DOCX, CSV file validation
- ✅ Temporary file storage
- ✅ Integration with CRM agent session

### State Persistence
- ✅ JSON file generation (`state.json`)
- ✅ Application state structure created
- ✅ Auto-save functionality implemented

### Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Endpoint returns full response structure
- ✅ File upload handling implemented
- ✅ Messages proxied to CRM agent
- ✅ Pipeline payload extraction ready
- ✅ Error handling implemented

## 🚀 Currently Running

### FastAPI Backend Server
- **URL:** http://localhost:8001
- **Status:** ✅ Running successfully
- **Documentation:** http://localhost:8001/docs
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:8001/

### Test Results
- ✅ All imports working correctly
- ✅ All Pydantic models validated
- ✅ State manager tested successfully
- ✅ Agent connection logic verified
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly

## 📋 Next Steps (Remaining Phases)

### Phase 2: Kanban Generator
- [ ] Parse `stage_name`, `brief_stage_goal`, `user_tags` from pipeline
- [ ] React Kanban component with dynamic columns
- [ ] Integration with backend state management

### Phase 3: Lead Chat UI
- [ ] FastAPI endpoint `/lead/chat`
- [ ] React chat widget for end-users
- [ ] Session management for leads
- [ ] Integration with Omni Stage Agent

### Phase 4: Live Sync
- [ ] WebSocket channel for state deltas
- [ ] Real-time Kanban card movement
- [ ] Lead table auto-updates
- [ ] React WebSocket integration

### Phase 5: Persistence & Export
- [ ] Enhanced state persistence
- [ ] Export endpoint `/export/prd`
- [ ] GCS bucket integration
- [ ] Restart state recovery

### Key Learnings
1. Vertex AI agents use `vertexai.agent_engines.get()` (not `google.adk.client`)
2. Import structure requires absolute imports for FastAPI modules
3. Agent session management requires careful state tracking
4. File uploads need integration with agent sessions
5. WebSocket broadcasting enables real-time UI updates

## 🎯 Current Status: **Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Frontend Development**

The backend is fully functional and ready to support the React frontend development. All core agent integration, state management, and API endpoints are working correctly.
